# MashambaHack Root

The Root is where we list MashambaHack Ideas.  
Let's Begin!
## Objectives
You may or may not know that we are in a deep ecological crisis.  Our population is growing at such a rate many talking heads are saying we need to double our food production by 2020.

That's a lot of food.

Mashamba doesn't think we need more land or more chemicals, or more genetic tinkering with plants that has served our species well for centuries.

We think that more intelligent land use in urban, peri-urban, rural, and aquatic areas is the key to abundance.  We think crowdgrowing is a solution, we think open source technology is a model and solution.
